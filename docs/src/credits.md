Many thanks to the [people](https://www.blender.org/about/people/) who develop Blender, without whom this addon would have no foundation to exist!

Transmogrifier used code from the following repositories in the following ways. If you give a star to this repository, please also do the same for theirs!

- Transmogrifier's GUI is based on [MrTriPie](https://github.com/mrtripie)'s excellent Blender addon, [Blender Super Batch Export](https://github.com/mrtripie/Blender-Super-Batch-Export) ([GPL-v3](https://www.blender.org/support/faq/#using-blender-8)). 

- Some additional code snippets have been adapted into Transmogrifier from the following repositories (search for their names in [Converter.py](https://github.com/SapwoodStudio/Transmogrifier/blob/main/Converter.py) to view the specific adaptations):

    - [Simple Renaming Panel](https://github.com/Weisl/simple_renaming_panel/)
    - [Node Wrangler](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/node/node_wrangler.html)
    - [asset_browser_utilities](https://github.com/Gorgious56/asset_browser_utilities)
